<img src="img/amazon_washpost.png" width="80%" />

--

- It started harmlessly:

  - *A team member was doing a bit of maintenance on Amazon Web Services Tuesday...*

--

  - *With a few mistaken keystrokes, ...*

--

  - *... The cascading failure meant that many websites could no longer make changes to the information stored on Amazon's cloud platform....*

--
- Amazon said: *We have modified this tool to remove capacity more slowly and **added safeguards to prevent** capacity from being removed when it will take any subsystem below its minimum required capacity level.*

--

<span style="color:purple">**Including tests is one of the possible safeguards when writing software!**</span>

---
### <span style="color:purple"> Why do we test software?</span>


- makes you think about desirable output

--

- improves readability of your code
   
   - good usage examples for others and your future self
   
   - helps to reuse your code

--

- raises your confidence when developing the code




---
###<span style="color:purple">Various types of tests</span>

--

- Unit tests

  - work on isolated parts (units) of the program
  - verify that units operate correctly in various scenarios
  - usually compare observed results to well known expected results


- Integration tests

  - combine individual software modules and test as a group
  - similar structure as unit tests: compare observed results to  expected results, but the expected result can be more complicated to represent

&nbsp;

--

- Regression tests

  - verify that software previously developed and tested still performs correctly even after it was changed or interfaced with other software

  - you don't have to knows the expected result, the assumption is that the past results were correct.

---

### <span style="color:purple">Science and software testing</span>

- We all question/test many things in our scientific work

- When writing a program we often execute a simple example first and check the output

&nbsp;

--

#### Writing software tests for your scientific code is:

  - translating your ideas for verification to programming code

  - automating the process of verification, so you can do it on a regular basis

## Testing tools
---
layout: false

### <span style="color:purple">Python testing frameworks</span>

- unittest

- nosetests

- pytest


&nbsp;

--

Which framework should you use?

- A great comparison of the frameworks you can find [here](http://pythontesting.net/start-here/)

- A short answer: **use pytest if you can**


---
### <span style="color:purple">Unit tests with Pytest library</span>


- itâ€™s easy to get started

- straightforward asserting with the assert statement

  ```python
  def test_1():
      assert 4 - 3 == 1

  def test_2():
      assert 4/3 > 6/5

  def test_3():
      assert "l" in "lalala"
  ```

- helpful traceback and failing assertion reporting

- automatic test discovery

  ```bash
  # discovers all tests in all subdirectories
  pytest
  # runs all test from test_random.py file only
  pytest tests_myfunctions.py
  # runs one specific test
  pytest tests_myfunctions.py::test_one_specific_test
  ```

- many useful features including fixtures, test parametrization, etc., 
that will be covered during the tutorial

---
### <span style="color:purple">Unit tests with Pytest library</span>

#### Additional options to pytest command 

- `-v` (`--verbose`): increase verbosity
  ```bash
  pytest -v
  ```

- `-s`: shortcut for --capture=no (can see print statements)
  ```bash
  pytest -s
  ```

- `--pdb`: start the interactive Python debugger on errors
  ```bash
  pytest --pdb
  ```

- `-h` (`--help`): full list of option
  ```bash
  pytest -h
  ```

## Our scientific project 
---
layout: false

#### <span style="color:purple"> Simulation of moving particles in a box...</span>

Assumptions:

- all particles have the same sizes, but can have different masses,

- box is rectangular,

- all collisions are elastic, 

- particles have different initial location and velocities.

---
#### <span style="color:purple"> Simulation of moving particles in a box...</span>

<video src="img/sim.mp4" controls preload></video>


--

- Does it work?

--

- Is it correct?

---

#### <span style="color:purple"> Simulation of moving particles in a box...</span>

It might be hard (impossible?) to write a test that can give the absolute answer...

--

...but we can think about multiple tests that increase our confidence!

--

Think about individual processes: 

- transport

- particles collision 

- hitting the wall

---

#### <span style="color:purple"> Testing transport </span>

Code is in:

```bash
~/pycontest/pycontest/transport.py
```

Tests will be in:
```bash
~/pycontest/tests/test_transport.py
```

--

Solution for the code is in:

```bash
~/pycontest/solutions/transport.py
```

--

- read about [skip/xfail](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/skipping.html)

---

#### <span style="color:purple"> Testing collisions: 1d </span>

##### Discuss the possible tests for 1d elastic collisions.

--

Code is in:

```bash
~/pycontest/pycontest/ellastic_collision.py
```

Tests will be in:
```bash
~/pycontest/tests/test_ellastic_collision.py
```

--

Examples of tests:

```bash
~/pycontest/solutions/test_ellastic_collision.py
```

--

-  check [pytest.approx](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#pytest-approx)

---

### <span style="color:purple">Unit tests with Pytest library</span>


#### TODO: Use pytest features to rewrite your tests sets

- read about [parametrization](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/parametrize.html) and try to use it within your test functions

- read about [skip/xfail](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/skipping.html) and
 and [exceptions check](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/assert.html#assertions-about-expected-exceptions), try to use it in your existing tests and write new tests

- check if your functions still pass all tests

- if your tests fail rewrite the function or at least use `pytest.mark.xfail`  and provide the `reason`


---

### <span style="color:purple">Regresion test </span>

- In scientific computing sometimes (often?) we don't know what is the ''correct'' output

- We can eyball the plots we create and deem them reasonable, but errors are still possible.

- In the absence of truth we can test if our results are the same as some reference simulation.


---
### <span style="color:purple">Pytest + Hypothesis </span>

- [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  package allows to specify expected range of values of your inputs.
  It tests for many combinations of values of input parameters.

- tutorial here at Pycon: [Escape from auto-manual testing with Hypothesis!](https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/91/) 

--
- our simple example will need:

  ```python
  from hypothesis import given, strategies as st                                 
   
  @given(mass1  = st.floats(min_value=.1, max_value=1e3),                        
         mass2  = st.floats(min_value=.1, max_value=1e3))                        
  def test_hypothesis(mass1, mass2):  
  ```
--
<span style="color:purple">**Add a test that uses hypothesis to check if kinetic energy is conserved.**</span>
```bash
~/pycontest/tests/test_hypothesis.py
```
Example solution:
```bash
~/pycontest/solutions/test_hypothesis.py
```

---
### <span style="color:purple">Automated testing </span>

  - Pros:
      - Build and check the code every time you (and others) change it
      - Get immediate feedback
      - Easily integrate testing into your workflow
      &nbsp;
      - Use various environments for testing the code

---
### <span style="color:purple">Scientific testing examples</span>

- No excuses for not writing unit tests!

- Sometimes you can use tests proposed in [existing publications](https://github.com/igfuw/libmpdataxx/tree/master/tests/mp3_paper_2018_JCP)

- Sometimes you are left with regresion testing against your [own published results](https://github.com/igfuw/libmpdataxx#3-to-reproduce-all-results-from-the-gmd-paper)
  (But wouldn't it be nice to be able to automatically generate all your previousely 
   published plots and results?)

  &nbsp;

- Try to:
    - write your code and your tests together
    - think of any analysis / plotting code as a potential test
    - automate
